# **fix**able

`fixable`, provided by [Accessible Community](https://www.accessiblecommunity.org), is a site designed to show common accessibility errors and how to fix them.

## Repository layout

* The [`site`](https://github.com/accessiblecommunity/fixable/tree/main/site) folder contains the javascript code used to build the site.
    * `fixable` is powered by [Astro](https://astro.build/).

## Setting up a Development Environment

On almost every project, getting your development environment established is the first task and it can take a day or two to do so. This is a high-level overview so that you can be productive quickly.

* If you don't have one, we recommend installing an IDE that supports multiple languages (Python, Javascript, HTML/CSS, etc). The recommendations are [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but really this is a developer choice.
* Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) or another way to run a containerized environment.
  * If on Windows, we recommend installing the [Linux Subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to help performance, but itâ€™s not required. See [configuring Docker Desktop to use WSL 2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/).
* Install a way to run `make`.
  * On Windows, use the Linux Subsystem or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
  * On Mac, install the Xcode client tools or use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
  * If preferred, install some integration with the IDE you are using instead.
