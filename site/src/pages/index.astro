          The search box automatically performs client-side navigation to
          the search page on a delay after input stops.
          There is no dedicated submit button and no warning about the behavior.
          (This may not be a failure for the search page itself.)
          The page title also does not update to reflect the page change.

          The collection links have explicit tabindex attributes, causing them to come before
          anything else in the page. The links in the "See More" section are
          not included in this explicit order, meaning focus tabs to each collection link,
          then header items, then the "See More" links, then the footer.
          Moreover, the explicit tab order is optimized specifically for the widest
          layout, making it incorrect even within the collections list on narrower viewports.
