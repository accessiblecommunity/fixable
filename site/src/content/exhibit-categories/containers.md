<p class="h4">Welcome to the Broken Containers Collection.</p>

Here, you'll find vases, jugs, pots, and bottles that used to hold all kinds of things like water, flowers, or even food. Some are cracked, others are chipped, and a few are missing pieces, but each one tells a story. The colorful pottery from faraway places, the smooth vintage bottles, and the carefully painted vases all once had a purpose. Even though they're broken, they are still beautiful and special.

Imagine a tall vase that once held bright flowers in someone’s home, or a big jug used to carry water long ago. Each container was important to someone in the past. Now, they rest here to show us how things don’t have to be perfect to have value. These broken containers remind us that everything, even if cracked or worn out, can have a history worth sharing. What do you think their stories might be?
