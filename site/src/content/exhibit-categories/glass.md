<p class="h4">Welcome to the Shattered Treasures Collection.</p>

Here, you’ll find broken drinking glasses, a green container, heart-shaped ornaments, mirrors, and even fancy wine glasses. Some of these items might have slipped and fallen, others might have cracked over time, but they all have special stories to tell. The heart-shaped ornament once hung proudly in someone's home, while the green container might have held something important. The mirrors used to reflect faces, and the wine glasses were used for happy celebrations, meal times, and in times of sadness.

Even though these objects are broken, they help us imagine the moments they were part of. Picture someone carefully holding a wine glass during a big party, or a person looking into one of these mirrors to fix their hair. These shattered pieces remind us that things can still be beautiful, even when they aren’t whole anymore. What kind of stories do you think these broken treasures would tell if they could talk?
