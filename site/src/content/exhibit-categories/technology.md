<p class="h4">Welcome to the Broken Technology Collection!</p>

Here, you’ll see a smashed old TV, a cracked CD, a disassembled camera, clocks taken apart, a broken smartphone, and even a shattered CRT monitor. These items were once used to take pictures, tell time, watch shows, and listen to music. The cracked smartphone might have been used to call friends or play games, and the disassembled clocks once helped people keep track of time. Even though they don’t work anymore, they remind us how important technology is in our lives.

Imagine someone watching their favorite show on the old TV or taking photos with the camera. The CD might have played fun music, and the clocks helped people know when to wake up or go to bed. Even though these items are broken now, they help us remember how people used to stay connected, enjoy entertainment, and keep track of time. What do you think their last moment of use was like before they broke?
