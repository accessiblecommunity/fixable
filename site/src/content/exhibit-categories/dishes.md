<p class="h4">Welcome to the Broken Plates Collection.</p>

Here, youâ€™ll see pieces of beautiful blue and white ceramic plates that were once used for meals in homes, big dinners, or even celebrations. Some plates have cracks, others are chipped, and a few are missing big pieces, but each one is special. The blue plates have delicate designs, while the white ones are simple but elegant. They may not be able to hold food anymore, but they still hold stories from long ago.

Imagine a family sitting around a table, passing food on one of these plates. Over time, the plates might have been dropped or broken, but they were once a part of everyday life. Now, these broken plates remind us that even things that are cracked or damaged can be remembered and treasured. Each broken piece has a story to tell! What do you think happened to them?
