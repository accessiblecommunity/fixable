<p class="h4">Welcome to the Broken Sports Gear Collection.</p>

Here, you’ll see a worn out basketball hoop, an old bicycle with a bent wheel, a deflated and torn football, a cracked skateboard, and a worn-out soccer ball. Each piece of equipment once helped people play, exercise, and have fun. The basketball hoop may have been used for exciting games, while the bicycle probably zoomed down streets or parks. Even though they’re broken now, they remind us of the joy of playing and being active.

Imagine kicking the soccer ball with friends or riding the bicycle on a sunny day. The football was once thrown in a big game, and the skateboard used to glide smoothly along the pavement. Though these items can't be used for sports anymore, they still tell stories of fun and excitement. What do you think happened during the last game or ride they were part of?
