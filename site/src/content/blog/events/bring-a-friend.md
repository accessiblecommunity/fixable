Bring a Friend, Share the Experience: Limited Time Offer!

For a limited time, the Museum of Broken Things is inviting you to share the unique experience of our exhibits with a friend—for free! From now until the end of the month, when you purchase a ticket, your friend gets in at no additional cost. Whether you want to explore the history of shattered dreams, broken roadways, or promises that didn’t quite hold, now’s the perfect opportunity to bring someone along for an unforgettable journey through the beautifully broken.

This special offer gives you the chance to reflect and connect with someone close as you explore the stories of things left behind, while also discovering how fractures in history, art, and personal lives come together in one extraordinary place. Don't miss this chance to double your experience while only paying for one—bring a friend, and see the museum through new eyes!
