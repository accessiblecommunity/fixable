The Museum of Broken Things is thrilled to unveil its newest exhibition, *Broken Promises: The Fragility of Commitments*, an evocative exploration of the promises that shape—and sometimes break—our lives. From personal vows to political pledges, the exhibition shines a spotlight on the most intimate and public of failures, inviting visitors to reflect on the promises they’ve made, broken, or been broken by. The exhibit reminds us that while promises are powerful, they are also fragile, shaped by our complex human nature.

At the heart of the exhibit are artifacts from broken promises that resonate deeply with visitors. A wedding ring returned after a broken engagement, a forgotten treaty between nations, and a child’s note to their parent promising to behave. These objects, while ordinary at first glance, carry the emotional weight of failed commitments, representing not just personal sorrow but collective disappointments. By displaying these items, the exhibit captures the way broken promises leave invisible scars, reshaping relationships, societies, and history.

This exhibition is more than a simple display of objects—it invites active participation. One of the interactive sections allows visitors to write down a promise they’ve broken or had broken and pin it to a wall of vows, creating a visual and emotional tapestry of fractured trust. As the wall grows throughout the exhibit’s run, it will serve as a living testament to the universality of broken promises. Whether it’s a friend who drifted away or a personal goal left unfulfilled, visitors will see reflections of their own experiences in the mounting collection.

Beyond personal promises, *Broken Promises* also examines the larger, more systemic failures that impact communities. Political promises are represented in historical documents, such as campaign flyers from leaders who didn’t deliver on their words or contracts from corporate giants that failed to protect their workers. This section of the exhibit encourages visitors to think critically about the nature of power and trust in societal structures, sparking dialogue about how broken promises shape governance, economics, and justice.

As you exit the exhibition, a final display poses a simple yet profound question: Can broken promises be mended? In this space, visitors are invited to consider the possibilities of reconciliation, forgiveness, and the lessons that come from acknowledging our imperfections. The Museum of Broken Things hopes that, through *Broken Promises*, visitors leave with a greater understanding of the delicate nature of trust and the importance of maintaining commitments in both their personal lives and the broader world.
