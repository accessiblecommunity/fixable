This summer, the Museum of Broken Things is excited to announce its very own summer camp program, offering a creative and educational experience for 60 children from grades 5 to 10. The camp is designed to encourage kids to explore history, art, and storytelling through the lens of objects that have been broken, discarded, or forgotten. It's a unique opportunity for young minds to dive into the world of broken things and learn how even damaged objects can hold beauty and meaning.

Children in grades 5 to 8 will be invited to participate in hands-on activities, arts and crafts, and interactive exhibits that bring the museum’s collection to life. Whether it's piecing together shattered pottery, creating art from recycled materials, or exploring the stories behind broken items, the camp is all about learning in a fun and creative way.

## Hands-On Fun For Grades 5 To 8

The camp has lots of exciting things planned for kids in grades 5 to 8. Each day, they will get to do different activities, like working on group projects and exploring the museum’s cool exhibits. They’ll even get to make their own art from old, broken things! Imagine turning a cracked vase into a sculpture or designing a new piece of jewelry from broken glass. The camp is all about using your imagination and learning how even broken things can be special.

Campers will also have the chance to go on scavenger hunts around the museum, solve fun puzzles, and hear stories about the objects on display. Every day will be filled with new discoveries, and they will even get to bring some of their creations home! This summer is a chance to make new friends, have fun, and learn something new about the world of broken things.

## Leadership Opportunities For Grades 9 And 10

For students in grades 9 and 10, the museum is offering leadership positions that will give older participants a unique role in guiding and mentoring younger campers. Those selected for leadership roles will help plan and organize activities, assist museum staff during workshops, and take on responsibilities in ensuring that the camp runs smoothly. This program is designed to build leadership skills, teamwork, and confidence, giving students a chance to step into a leadership role in a supportive and creative environment.

In addition to leadership responsibilities, students in grades 9 and 10 will also participate in advanced workshops that dive deeper into the themes of restoration and conservation. They will explore how museums preserve damaged objects and even learn about the field of artifact restoration. This experience will not only provide valuable leadership opportunities but also offer insights into careers in museums, history, and art.

## Learning And Creativity For All Ages

The museum's summer camp is built around the idea that broken things have stories to tell, and every child will get to explore that idea in their own way. Younger campers will focus on fun, hands-on activities that spark creativity, while older campers will have the chance to lead, guide, and delve deeper into the museum's themes. The camp will foster an environment of learning, collaboration, and discovery for every participant.

At the end of the camp, a special showcase will be held where campers can display their creations and share what they’ve learned with family and friends. It’s the perfect opportunity to show how they’ve transformed broken items into works of art and to celebrate the idea that broken things still have value. The museum is thrilled to welcome campers for a summer filled with creativity, learning, and fun!
