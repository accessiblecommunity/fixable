Welcome to the Broken Grand Piano exhibit!

This piano was once a beautiful instrument that filled rooms with music. It had big black and white keys that someone would press to make lovely sounds. Now, the piano is cracked, some of the keys are missing, and its strings are broken. Even though it can no longer play a tune, you can still see the large shape and remember how grand it must have been when it worked.

A grand piano is a very special instrument that makes music by pressing keys that hit strings inside. But over time, this piano became too old and worn out. The lid is cracked, the pedals are rusty, and it can no longer make music. Even though it’s broken, it’s a reminder of how important music is and how, once upon a time, this piano helped create wonderful songs. Now, it tells a new story, one about how things change but are still special in their own way.
