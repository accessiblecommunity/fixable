Welcome to the Broken Portable Cassette Player exhibit!

This small machine was once used to play music and listen to radio stations on the go. People would put a cassette tape inside, press play, and hear their favorite songs through the speakers. But now, the buttons are stuck, the antenna is bent, and the cassette door won’t close properly. Even though it’s broken, you can still see where people used to press buttons to play, pause, and rewind their music.

The portable cassette player and radio were really popular before smartphones and digital music. It was something you could carry around to enjoy tunes or listen to news on the radio. Now, its wires are worn out, and the sound doesn’t work anymore. Even though it can't play music like it used to, it reminds us of how people once enjoyed their favorite songs and stayed connected to the world. Now, it tells a new story about how things change, but they still hold memories of the past.
