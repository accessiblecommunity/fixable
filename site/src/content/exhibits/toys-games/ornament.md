Welcome to the Broken Ornament exhibit!

This shiny red ornament was once a beautiful decoration on someone’s Christmas tree. Now, it is cracked and missing pieces, with sharp edges where the glass has broken. The bright red color still sparkles in the light, but the ornament can no longer hang on the tree. Even though it’s damaged, it reminds us of the special moments and joy it brought during the holiday season.

Ornaments like this one are used to make Christmas trees look festive and magical. This red ornament might have been carefully placed on a tree each year, bringing cheer to the home. Now, with its cracks and missing parts, it tells the story of past celebrations and memories of Christmases long ago. Even though it’s broken, it still holds a little piece of holiday spirit.
