Welcome to the Broken Game Controller exhibit!

This controller, once used for playing exciting video games, is now cracked and missing a few buttons. The colorful buttons that used to make the characters move are scratched and worn out. The cord is frayed, showing signs of being twisted and pulled too many times during fun and challenging games. Even though it’s broken, you can still imagine how much fun it brought to someone who played with it for hours.

The game controller was an important tool for exploring different worlds in video games, helping the player jump, race, and battle through levels. Now, with its buttons stuck and pieces missing, it can’t be used anymore. But looking at it reminds us of the excitement and joy that came with each game. Even though this controller is broken, it tells the story of the fun and adventure it once helped create.
