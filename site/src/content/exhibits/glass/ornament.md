Welcome to the Broken Heart-Shaped Glass exhibit.

Perception and ambiguity play a central role. This piece of broken glass has sparked diverse reactions among viewers, with some insisting it resembles a heart, while others see only a jagged, irregular fragment. The glass, with its sharp edges and uneven curves, seems to evoke the outline of a heart for those inclined to find beauty in imperfection. For these viewers, the piece speaks to the delicate and often fragmented nature of love itself, where even the sharpest edges can form a symbol of affection or vulnerability.

Yet for others, the resemblance is far from clear. The glass’s irregular shape and harsh angles create confusion, blurring the lines between what is symbolic and what is merely accidental. Its jagged edges and asymmetry disrupt the traditional, symmetrical heart shape, leaving some viewers uncertain about its intended form. The piece challenges the very notion of recognizable symbols, highlighting how personal interpretation can transform an object into something more meaningful—or leave it lost in ambiguity. This divergence in perception underscores the role of individual perspective in shaping meaning from fractured, incomplete forms.

The debate surrounding this glass fragment reflects broader themes of interpretation, subjectivity, and the complexity of human emotion. For some, the broken glass is a metaphor for love’s fragility, an imperfect heart that mirrors the realities of relationships, where beauty and pain often coexist. For others, it is simply a shattered piece of glass, devoid of any deeper significance. This exhibit asks viewers to confront their own biases in searching for meaning, reminding us that what we see—or fail to see—is often shaped by our personal experiences and emotional lens. The brokenness of the glass, much like love itself, defies easy categorization.
