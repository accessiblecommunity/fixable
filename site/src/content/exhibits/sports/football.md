Welcome to the Broken (American) Football exhibit.

This football, which looks very much like a rugby ball, was once firm and ready for action, but is now deflated and worn out. The leather surface is scratched and torn, and the white laces are fraying. You can still see the faint markings where players’ hands gripped it, throwing passes and making catches. Although it can’t be used in a game anymore, it’s easy to imagine the fast-paced action it was once part of.

American footballs are designed to be strong and durable, perfect for tackles, throws, and runs across the field. This broken football has been through many tough games and practices, with its once-sharp edges now softened and its shape bent out of place. The deflated ball may no longer fly through the air, but it still carries the memories of touchdowns, team huddles, and hard-fought games. It serves as a reminder of the excitement and energy that come from playing sports, even when the ball itself is no longer in perfect shape.
