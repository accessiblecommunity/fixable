Welcome to the Soccer Ball exhibit.

This soccer ball, once bright with orange and blue colors, is now fading and fraying at the seams. The surface is scuffed and worn from many kicks, passes, and goals, and the stitching is coming undone in several places. Even though it can’t be used for a game anymore, you can still imagine all the times it bounced across the field, helping players practice their skills and enjoy exciting matches.

Soccer balls like this one are at the heart of countless games, bringing friends together for fun and competition. This ball shows the signs of hours of play, with its colors faded from sunlight and its seams stretched from being kicked around. While it’s no longer in good condition, the worn-out ball holds memories of teamwork, goals scored, and laughter shared on the field. It reminds us of the joy and energy that comes from playing soccer, even when the ball itself is too tired to keep going.
