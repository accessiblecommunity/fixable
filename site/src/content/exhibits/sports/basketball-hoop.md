Welcome to the Broken Basketball Hoop exhibit.

This hoop once stood tall on a driveway or playground, where players would shoot hoops and enjoy countless games. Now, the metal rim is bent and rusted, the backboard is cracked, and the net hangs loosely in frayed pieces. It’s clear this hoop saw many exciting moments—close games, long shots, and friendly competitions. Even though it’s no longer fit for play, you can still imagine the sound of the ball bouncing and swishing through the net.

Basketball hoops are often symbols of teamwork, skill, and practice. This particular hoop may have witnessed players perfecting their jump shots or learning to dribble. Its once-sturdy frame has been worn down by time and weather, but the marks of wear and tear tell the story of its past. Although it can’t serve its original purpose anymore, the broken hoop stands as a reminder of all the fun, dedication, and energy it once brought to those who played beneath it.
