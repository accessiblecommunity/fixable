Welcome to the Broken Skateboard exhibit.

This skateboard, once used for tricks and rides around the neighborhood, is now snapped at one end. The wooden board is cracked, with jagged edges where it broke, and the grip tape is peeling away. The wheels, though still attached, are worn down from hours of skating. Even though it can’t be ridden anymore, you can still imagine the rider practicing jumps, flips, and cruising down the streets on this once-trusty board.

Skateboards are often symbols of freedom and creativity, letting riders move fast and perform amazing stunts. This broken skateboard likely saw many exciting moments before it snapped, whether from a hard landing or a tricky maneuver. The crack at the end shows the wear and tear of time and use, but it also tells the story of someone pushing their limits and having fun. Even though it’s now damaged, the skateboard serves as a reminder of all the adventures it once carried through parks, sidewalks, and skateparks.
