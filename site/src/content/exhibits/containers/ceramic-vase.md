This tiny vase, only about three inches tall, comes from the time of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt. Its surface is a mix of different brown shades, created from the natural clay found along the Nile River. Even though the vase is broken and has a crack along its lip, it still shows us the incredible craftsmanship of the ancient Egyptians. The vase may have once been used to hold precious oils or perfumes.

The vase was made using a technique called slipcasting, where liquid clay is poured into a mold to create the shape. The crack along the lip happened after years of wear and tear, but it still reminds us of how long this object has survived. The swirling brown colors were likely made through a process called marbling, where different clays are mixed together to create a beautiful pattern. Even though it's small and broken, the vase still holds a connection to the people who made and used it.

In ancient Egypt, vases like this were often used in daily life or placed in tombs as offerings to the gods. This vase could have been part of someoneâ€™s household or used in important ceremonies. The broken lip and cracks might seem like flaws, but they tell a story of how this vase has lasted through centuries. It may no longer be perfect, but it still helps us understand the art, culture, and life of the ancient Egyptians.
