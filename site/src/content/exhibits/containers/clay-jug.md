This old clay jug was discovered in a farmer’s field in England, and it might be as old as Roman times. The jug is made from a rough, reddish-brown clay and was probably used to hold water or wine. Over time, the jug has developed cracks and chips, showing its long history of use and age. Even though it’s broken now, it gives us a glimpse into what life was like when the Romans were living in Britain.

The jug was likely made using a method called wheel-throwing, where the clay is shaped on a spinning wheel. This was a common technique in Roman times and allowed the potter to make the jug quickly and evenly. The jug would have been fired in a hot oven called a kiln, which made the clay hard and strong. While some of the jug has crumbled away, you can still see the curved shape of its body and the handle where someone would have held it to pour.

Finding objects like this in fields is a way to learn about the past. The jug might have been used by a Roman family living in the countryside or left behind when a village was abandoned. It’s amazing to think that something made so long ago can still be found today, even if it’s broken. This jug helps us understand how people lived, worked, and survived during Roman times in Britain.
