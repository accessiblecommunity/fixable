Welcome to the Broken Vasai Pottery Jugs exhibit.

These jugs come from Vasai in India, a place known for its long tradition of pottery-making. Each jug was handmade from clay, with rich, earthy colors like brown and red. Even though these jugs are broken now, you can still see their original shape and beauty. Some are cracked down the middle, while others have pieces missing, but each one tells the story of the people who used them in their daily lives.

The jugs were made using a method called hand-coiling, where long rolls of clay were carefully stacked and shaped into the form of the jug. After they were shaped, they were baked in a special oven called a kiln to make the clay hard and strong. Some of the broken jugs still have patterns on them, showing that the potters decorated them with great care. These decorations often included lines, dots, and other designs that made each jug unique.

Even though these jugs are broken, they help us learn about life in Vasai long ago. The jugs were used to carry water, store food, and in some cases, for special ceremonies. The cracks and chips on each jug show that they were used many times before they broke. These broken jugs remind us that even everyday objects can tell us a lot about the past and the people who made and used them.
