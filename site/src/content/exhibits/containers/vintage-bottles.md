This old wooden crate, once used to carry bottles full of beer, now holds a collection of broken glass. The crate and the shattered bottles inside have been sprayed with white paint, creating a ghostly appearance that makes them look frozen in time. The bottles are jagged and sharp, with their necks and bases cracked and chipped, telling the story of a time when they were carelessly dropped or broken. Though they can no longer hold anything, they still remind us of their past purpose.

The crate, likely made from rough-hewn wood, was once sturdy enough to transport heavy glass bottles full of beer. Over the years, the wood has worn down, and the bottles inside have been shattered beyond repair. The white paint sprayed over everything creates a striking contrast, highlighting the rough texture of the wood and the sharp edges of the glass. Itâ€™s as if the paint has preserved the moment when the bottles broke, capturing the sharp sound of shattering glass and the clatter of bottles falling.

Though broken, this crate of beer bottles speaks to the fragility of everyday objects. Beer bottles, which are so familiar and common, are easily taken for granted, but here we see them in a different light. The once smooth and shiny glass is now a jagged puzzle of broken pieces, while the crate that held them is scarred and marked by time. The spray of white paint adds an eerie layer, transforming these everyday items into a frozen reminder of the past.
