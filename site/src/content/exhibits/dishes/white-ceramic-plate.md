Welcome to the Broken White Ceramic Plates exhibit.

These shattered remnants of once-pristine plates reveal the delicate craftsmanship of their creators. Once smooth and unblemished, the white ceramic plates were likely used for formal dining or special occasions. Their clean, simple design speaks to a timeless elegance, but time and accidents have left them cracked, chipped, and incomplete. While they can no longer serve their original purpose, these broken pieces hold a quiet beauty, frozen in their fractured state.

The plates were made using a process called slipcasting, where liquid clay, or slip, was poured into a mold to create the smooth, symmetrical form. After being shaped, they were fired in a kiln at high temperatures to harden the clay, and later, a glossy white glaze was applied to give them their polished finish. This thin glaze, while beautiful, is fragile, and over the years, the plates were easily damaged by use or mishandling. Each crack and break tells a story of wear, whether from being dropped during a meal or chipped in storage.

Even in their broken form, the plates still offer insight into their history. White ceramic plates like these were often symbols of refinement, used in homes where meals were more than just nourishment, but a time for family gatherings or entertaining guests. The fractures running through these plates represent the passage of time and the inevitable fragility of material things. Though broken, they serve as a reminder of the moments they were once a part of, and how even the most ordinary objects can hold meaning long after theyâ€™ve lost their original function.
